# Notes App

A Flutter mini-app for taking notes with Firebase authentication and Firestore CRUD operations. Built using clean architecture and Bloc state management.

## Features
- Email/password sign up and login (Firebase Auth)
- Add, read, update, and delete notes (Firestore)
- Clean architecture: data, domain, and presentation layers
- Bloc for all state management (no setState for shared data)
- SnackBars for all success/error feedback
- Loader during initial fetch
- Responsive UI with Cards, dialogs, and confirmation alerts

## Project Structure
```
lib/
  data/         # Data sources, models, repositories (Firebase)
  domain/       # Entities, repositories, use cases (business logic)
  presentation/ # UI, Bloc, pages, widgets
```

## State Management: Bloc
- All authentication and notes logic is handled by Bloc.
- UI widgets use BlocListener and BlocBuilder to react to state changes.
- No business logic in UI widgets.
- Example: `NotesBloc` manages all note CRUD actions and emits states like `NotesLoading`, `NotesLoaded`, `NotesError`.

## Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Email/Password authentication.
3. Create Firestore database (in test mode for development).
4. Download `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the appropriate folders.
5. Update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase config (auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd notes_app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
